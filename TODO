TODO:

[High Priority - Under active work]
	- More helper functions for less repeated code in modules.
	- Make message hooks not use raw events!!!
	- Make module loading not return arbitrary status info as strings.

[Medium Priority - Next on the list.]
	- Better command hook system, delegate more to the command handler instead of the module.

[Low Priority - Will get done when everything else is out of the way.]
	- Make permissions check NickServ logins (maybe)
	- Per-command user whitelist/blacklist
	- Per-command/channel ratelimiting.
